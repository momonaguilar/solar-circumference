# solar-circumference client
This project aims to calculate solar circumference as precise as possible by allowing value of PI to be used in calculating as expandable as possible.

## setup
1. Clone repository
2. Run the server application

[CLIENT]

```sh
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Client IP : localhost:3000
Client app is also planned to be soon hosted in [Github Pages](https://momonaguilar.github.io/solar-circumference/) [TBD]

## actions
1. ```Add PI precision ``` - clicking + button will call server to get next PI digit
2. ```Calculate sun circumference ``` - updates sun circumference (upto certain digits only)
3. ```Reset PI value ``` - sets PI value back to 3

## client short-falls

1. Basic layout jer!

## opportunities moving forward

1. Make layout more appealing
2. Have ability to decrease PI digit
3. Introduce loading while server is busy on calculating large process, to make front-end experience seamless
4. Ability to perform testing end to end

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
